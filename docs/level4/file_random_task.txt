The following program  writes 5 sets of data to a file called cars.dat. 

Each record in the file is 38 bytes long (see comments in the code)

Using the length of the data fields (e.g. make is 10 chars) you can establish how to retrieve 
specific parts of the data.

The objects created using the fstream library maintain a file position variable as follows:

    ifstream keeps an internal get position with the location of the element to be read in the next input operation.

    ostream, keeps an internal put position with the location where the next element has to be written.

    fstream, keeps both, the get and the put position, like iostream.

These internal stream positions point to the locations within the stream where the next reading or writing operation is performed. 

These positions can be observed and modified using the following member functions:

    tellg() and tellp()
    These two member functions with no parameters return a value of the member type streampos, 
    which is a type representing the current get position (in the case of tellg) or the put position (in the case of tellp).

    seekg() and seekp()
    These functions allow to change the location of the get and put positions. Both functions are overloaded with two different prototypes. The first form is:

    seekg ( position );
    seekp ( position );

The task is to access the data file and achieve the following:

(1) Read each record (make, mode, colour, bhp, mpg) and print them out to the console one record per line
(2) Calculate the average mpg figure
(3) Print out the car with the highest bhp figure
(4) Modify the colour and mpg data for the Citroen, the print out all the records again (as in (1))
